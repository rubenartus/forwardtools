I would share a rough idea and through our dialogue, I could better understand the problem space and explore new directions. The AI's role is less about suggesting solutions, and more about facilitating an uninterrupted flow of thought:</p>"},"id":"039e94a8-48c6-44e5-953c-36595f43a6b7","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<ul><li>I don't need to write down anything; I just speak and a complete transcript is made, allowing me to revisit and compile the best ideas later.</li><li>When struggling to recall a specific name or concept or word, I just describe it and the AI often knows the answer, keeping my thoughts focused.</li><li>I can ask the AI to summarize our conversation (or parts of it) at any point, helping me see which aspects of the idea need more thought.</li><li>And I can have the AI pose questions to me and critiquing specific parts of the idea to uncover what I've only superficially considered.</li></ul>"},"id":"c62f054d-88ef-4d83-aaf3-b9a1ac72d7cb","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The AI brainstorm-partner is always available, as long as I haven't reached the daily GPT-4 usage limit, which unfortunately happens more often than I'd like!

There's an additional mental step involved, such as pressing a button to interrupt the AI when it misunderstands me or when I want to add another idea. Also, occasionally my silence is misinterpreted as random words. It would be fantastic, and I believe achievable in the near future, to have a two-way stream where I can talk while the AI is speaking, and it would naturally pause, listening to my input.</p><p>The ChatGPT interface is designed more for single conversations than for ongoing dialogues with multiple outcomes. In idea sessions, I often have to sift through long chats to extract relevant parts. An interface that allows for marking certain parts of the conversation for easy access would be useful. Additionally, the ability to categorize conversations into projects or tag them by idea stage would be helpful. Also over long conversations, the AI's responses can become less focused. To counter this, I sometimes begin a new chat with just the relevant parts as the starting message, which helps the AI maintain focus on what matters to me and deliver better quality responses.</p>"},"id":"918f6544-4be7-4c8c-bab9-5ef5479b5829","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Sometimes, after I share an idea and the AI begins its response, I intentionally interrupt it (by tapping the interface) and throw in another idea, maybe even a third. Then, I return to the transcript and read the AI's response. It's like a braindump where the AI provides much better quality responses than if I had mentioned all three ideas in a single prompt.</p><p>Finally, I've switched from using voice chat to text chat. This is because I'm utilizing a custom GPT with specific instructions that enhance the brainstorming sessions. Unfortunately, these instructions don't apply in voice chat – likely a limitation of OpenAI's technology to maintain voice chat speed. However, I believe it's only a matter of time before this is addressed, and I can converse with my \"AI MUSE\" using voice chat. :)</p><p>Here's my AI MUSE GPT as an example, in case you're interested in creating a similar tool:</p>"},"id":"03bb1d62-e678-4818-869d-da421a194670","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://OMwMZAtiqH3va2n0"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"AI Design Muse — Engaging Creative Collaborator","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"c35f5556-8656-41a4-a5ca-c7138fd587bf","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"'AI Design Muse' is your imaginative and insightful design ally, adept in UX/UI and AI-related brainstorming.
