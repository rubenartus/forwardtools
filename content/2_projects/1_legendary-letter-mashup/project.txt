It utilizes the unpredictability of LLMs to our advantage, placing it at the forefront as the main attraction. Players relinquish direct control, instead indirectly influencing the outcome of each round.</p><p>But first, let's consider why designing with generative AI is so challenging today.</p>"},"id":"a052c637-f60f-44e1-be2b-61b5eadf4ac0","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Dealing with randomness"},"id":"591713ea-297f-408a-983d-deddcbef9bfd","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Generative AI is inherently random, often yielding different answers to the same question. By controlling their output in terms of format, reliability, and safety, we can better integrate them into existing systems for daily use and even more serious applications, allowing them to act as autonomous agents. That's why substantial engineering effort is invested in making generative AI more deterministic.</p><p>In the art world, which includes writing, brainstorming, or games, the creative and random nature of AI can be embraced, often leading to unexpected and surprising results. This \"yes, and...\" approach represents a new capability in computing, creatively applicable to various forms of art. This area is still largely unexplored, with much potential for fantastic ideas.</p><p>Focusing on games, many well-known ones like League of Legends, Counter-Strike, or StarCraft are competitive with clear rules, where skill often determines the winner, not luck. These games create a fair playing field.</p><p>However, there's a different category of games centered on the experience, designed to evoke emotions and offer new perspectives on life. Here, generative AI will be at home, allowing players' imagination and creativity to play an even bigger role than before possible.</p>"},"id":"cbe13353-a7c5-4a60-b66b-7ae7d8636fa7","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Static and dynamic surprises"},"id":"f73dc5d8-3e40-4470-9eff-cd433177f16a","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Games historically used algorithms to generate assets, interactions with NPCs, and worlds. Building and maintaining these technologies is challenging, and they often lack the desired dynamic responsiveness. Examples include Minecraft and Spelunky, which create new worlds for players to ensure a surprising experience. A key advantage is reproducibility: using a specific seed (usually a number), the algorithm can recreate the same world, a feature not possible with Large Language Models.</p><p>LLMs are pretty good at basic reasoning and excel in generating, mixing, and transforming text and images. There are three main ways this capability can be utilized by game designers and engineers.</p><p>The most apparent use, often discussed in headlines, is in generating game assets during production. While there are concerns about job loss, I view this as a shift towards an era where artists are unburdened from mundane tasks. Instead of painstakingly drawing, building, and painting each asset, artists can use AI to handle the more tedious and repetitive tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the creative aspects that require taste and a distinct point of view.</p><p>The second method involves incorporating Large Language Models into games for direct interactions. Many hope for NPCs in role-playing games to converse naturally with players, reacting with context and awareness of previous in-game events. This development promises more immersive gaming experiences, not just in RPGs like Skyrim, but also in simulation games like Sim City and digital pets like Tamagotchi.</p><p>The third approach is the indirect use of LLMs, where game content is dynamically created based on user input. This can be seen in \"choose your own adventure\" games or in crafting entire storylines and worlds influenced by players' decisions. This reminds many of real-world role-playing games, where a game master designs the story, and players' choices only subtly shape the journey. In the next part, we will explore this type of generative AI in games, with the game concept for \"Legendary Letter Mashup – LLM.\"</p>"},"id":"2d76e11f-138f-4edb-a299-b6d0f1f6ad7a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h1","text":"Competing with letters"},"id":"874bd098-0cbe-4054-9a6b-901f4540b5ca","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Legendary Letter Mashup was co-created by brainstorming with a large language model, like most of my ideas these days.
