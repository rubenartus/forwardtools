  <p class="md:w-2/3 text-2xl">Hey there, I'm <a href="http://ruben.design" target="_blank">Ruben</a>, on a mission to advance the field of AI UX design, fully leveraging the dynamic medium of computers.</p>

      <p class="mt-5 text-lg">As an independent researcher, my path is all about posing big, sometimes quirky questions, and then diving headfirst into finding answers. The projects you'll see here represent my way of navigating these questions, turning "what ifs" into tangible "aha moments." They aim to inspire you about the possibilities with AI, combining serious design thinking with a healthy dose of playfulness.</p>
      
      <p class="mt-5 text-lg">Keep an eye on my open research questions as well. They're not just idle curiosities; they're the seeds of future projects, ideas ready to unfold. Each one is an invitation to explore, to challenge, and to join me in shaping the future of AI UX design.</p>
      
      <p class="mt-5 text-lg">You won't find me on social media, but I'd be delighted to <a href="mailot:ruben@forward.tools">get mail from you</a>. Alongside my research, I offer workshops and consulting in AI design and engineering. Additionally, I co-host a <a target="_blank" href="http://dieKI.show">German AI podcast</a> with my friend Benny.</p>
